- ðŸ‘‹ Hello World, Iâ€™m @markwellj!

- Check out some work/code from my master's and undergraduate degrees below.

- I'm a graduate of the University of Edinburgh's MSc in Business Analytics program.

- I'm interested in finding nuances and patterns in data, regardless of the subject matter. 

- I particularly love complex relational data and using it to answer questions,
  even if those questions haven't even been asked. Sometimes, the data does all the talking.
  
- ðŸ“« I'm easily reachable at:
