- ðŸ‘‹ Hello World, Iâ€™m @markwellj!

- I'm a recent graduate from the University of Edinburgh's MSc in Business Analytics program.

- I'm interested in finding nuances and patterns in data, regardless of the subject matter. 

- I particularly love complex relational data and using it to answer question,
  even if those questions haven't even been asked. Sometimes, the data does all the talking.
  
- Currently, amidst looking for jobs, I am completing Udemy's MySQL bootcamp to increase my language abilities and gain 
  greater insight into application web development.

- ðŸ“« I'm easily reachable at:
